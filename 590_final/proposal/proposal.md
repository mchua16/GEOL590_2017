Proposal Description
--------------------

**Who will participate in the final project?**

Michelle Chua

**Will the project will be a data analysis project or a package?**

Package

**Which git workflow from the Chacon text you will use?**

Integration-Manager Workflow

**What is the background for the need for the project? I.e., what problem does it solve, and why does that problem need to be solved?**

I will try to generate a package that can take the mean of absorbances. These absorbances will then be used to generate a growth curve. Ideally, I would be able to calculate the R-sqaured of the exponential phase of the growth curves. The R-squared could be used to compare the growth rates of any microbial strain to another or several microbial strains.

**What is the source of the data? Will real-world data or made-up data be used?**

Growth curve data that I obtained from mutants (and wild-type) generated in the Buchan lab. For my research, I often have to compare the growth rates of the mutant strains to the wild-type strains.

**What specifications will the final project meet? I.e., what will you produce (a single plot of this vs that, a set of tools that does these three things, etc)?**

The final project should perform the following three things:

1.  Take the mean of absorbances, which really could be any number including CFU/mL or cells/mL, but for my purposes, it would be absorbance.

2.  Generate a growth curve of time vs. absorbance.

3.  Calculate the R-squared of the exponential phase of the growth curve.
